# Learning-System-Project

Learning System Project on Back Propagation Network and Reinforcement Learning
September, 2017 â€“ December, 2017
- Implemented Q-learning with LUT in Java on my robot tank to see a convergence of winning rate from 50% to 90% beating another robot tank
- Did experiments and analysis on on-policy and off-policy learning and on the influence of exploration rate
- Replaced the LUT with a combination of five Back propagation neural networks and removed the state space reduction
- Used the neural net based reinforcement learning to realize the significant raise of winning rate of my robot tank against another tank

The implementation requires robocode environment. The [code](code) includes 3 parts, [BP neural net](code/BpNeuralNet), [robot with LUT](code/rlRobot), [robot with NN](code/rlRobotNew).
